Class diagram:----
Here I have considered the main classes of my Parking Lot System:

ParkingLot: The central part of the organization for which this software has been designed. It has attributes like ‘Name’ to distinguish it from any other parking lots and ‘Address’ to define its location.

ParkingFloor: The parking lot will have many parking floors.

ParkingSpot: Each parking floor will have many parking spots. Our system will support different parking spots 1) Handicapped, 2) Compact, 3) Large, 4) Motorcycle, and 5) Electric.

Display board:-To display status.


Vehicle: Vehicles will be parked in the parking spots. Our system will support different types of vehicles 1) Car, 2) Truck, 3) Electric, 4) Van and 5) Motorcycle.

EntrancePanel and ExitPanel: EntrancePanel will print tickets, and ExitPanel will facilitate payment of the ticket fee.

Payment: This class will be responsible for making payments. The system will support credit card and cash transactions.

ParkingRate: This class will keep track of the hourly parking rates.
