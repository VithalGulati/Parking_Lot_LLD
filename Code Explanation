Requirements considered:

The parking lot can have multiple levels.
Each level can have 'compact', 'large', 'bike' and 'electric' spots.
Vehicle should be charged according to spot type, time of parking and duration of parking.
Should be able to add more spots to level.
Show the available number of spots on each level.



Used enums over strings


I added some more functionality like -
Car / Bike classes extend the Vehicle Base Class
Ticket has Vehicle, Spot and Payment objects
Have added unassignSpot() as well.
